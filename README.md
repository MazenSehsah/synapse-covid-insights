# Azure Synapse & Power BI: COVID-19 Data Insights (2020‚Äì2023)

This project showcases how to process, analyze, and visualize global **COVID-19 data** using **Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics** and **Power BI**.  
It demonstrates the complete pipeline ‚Äî from ETL and data modeling to dynamic dashboard visualization.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

The data contains detailed COVID-19 case records, including:
- Total Confirmed Cases  
- Total Deaths  
- Total Recovered  
- Country/Region and Temporal Information  

The **ETL process** was performed in **Azure Synapse**, transforming raw data into structured tables and views to support fast and efficient visualization in **Power BI**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing (ETL)

- Data was extracted from global COVID-19 datasets.  
- Transformations included data cleaning, aggregation, and summarization.  
- Data was loaded into a relational database schema within **Azure Synapse**.  
- A dedicated table `Covid_Info` stores the core dataset.  

### Database Views:
| View Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `View_Summary` | Holds the total confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active numbers. |
| `View_Covid_Trend` | Shows total confirmed, deaths, and recoveries by year. |
| `View_Location` | Displays the top 10 countries by total confirmed cases. |
| `View_Top_Countries` | Highlights top 10 countries with highest confirmed and death counts. |
